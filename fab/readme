ifabtest.py helps you run TCP streams between multiple endpoints.

ifabtest.py uses iperf3 to generate traffic. 
It uses 'fabric' to execute shell commands remotely.  

The machine where you run ifabtest.py is called 'runner'.
The machines which run iperf3 are called 'targets'

PREREQUISITES:

1. Install python v2 on runner
2. Install fabric on runner
     pip install 'fabric<2.0'
3. Install yaml on runner
     apt install python-yaml

USAGE:

 $ ./ifabtest.py -h
usage: ifabtest.py [-h] [--duration DURATION] [--pthreads PTHREADS]
                   config_file

positional arguments:
  config_file          Input yaml file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --duration DURATION  duration
  --pthreads PTHREADS  parallel threads


 Create a yml file containing the configuration. You can copy and modify the example yml file.
 Run 'iperf3 -s &' on the target servers.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
$ ./ifabtest.py conf1.yml --duration 30 --pthreads 4
